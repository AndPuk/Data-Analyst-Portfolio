1. Theory
   
Freight value has an impact on a customer's decision to buy a product or not.

2. Hypothesis

High freight value reduces sales.

3 .Metrics

Linear regression of freight values variables, freight values segmentation, freight values, and price correlation, freight values trends over time, product category by revenue - pareto, product categories price brands.

4. Modeling and inference

Does higher freight value reduce sales?

5. Counterfactual hypothesis

Lower freight values increase sales.

6. Insights

a) Product weight has the highest impact on freight value;

b) After freight value reaches 25% of the overall product price it starts to negatively affect sales;

Freight values positively correlate with prices;

Over time overall freight values increase followed by the number of orders, while prices decrease;

20% of product categories generate 80% of revenue;

Out of the 20% most revenue-generating product categories office furniture has the highest average freight value;

Over time the 20% of most revenue-generating product category's freight values increase;

Out of the 20% of most revenue-generating product categories lowest average freight values generate the highest number of orders;

Geographical location has an impact on sales: the highest average freight value by customer & seller states have the lowest number of orders.

7. Conclusion

The hypothesis cannot be rejected because freight values after a certain value level start to discourage customers from making purchases.

8. Recommendations:

Freight value estimation should be improved to reduce shipping costs because freight value trends do not correspond to overall trends in product pricing and the number of orders. Potential improvement could be achieved by addressing the unequal geographical distribution of customers by opening more seller distribution centers outside the San Paulo urban area.
