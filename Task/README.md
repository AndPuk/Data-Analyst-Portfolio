I am an analyst in the Olist company in the Payments & Monetisation department, which is responsible for understanding your clients' (merchants who are on Olist platform) data from a payments perspective. As it is quite a big company, it has this separate department that basically improves SaaS (Software as a Service) products with help from me. My analysis plays an important role in what kind of product changes are implemented and whether the company manages to optimize its efforts in growing its revenue. My main stakeholder is the product manager in the Payments & Monetisation team, but occasionally, I get requests from other departments, since I am a company expert on transactional payments data.

I used a single database called olist_db consisting of transactional payments and orders data from Olist of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018. There are 8+1 datasets to play with and explore. The data model has been described in the image below and it is organized and normalized for each category:
