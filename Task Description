I am an analyst in the Olist company in the Payments & Monetisation department, which is responsible for understanding your clients' (merchants who are on Olist platform) data from a payments perspective.
As it is quite a big company, it has this separate department which basically improves SaaS (Software as a Service) products with help from you. Your analysis plays an important role in what kind of product
changes are implemented and whether the company manages to optimize their efforts in growing their revenue. Your main stakeholder is the product manager in the Payments & Monetisation team, but occasionally,
you get requests from other departments, since you are a company expert on transactional payments data.
