1. Theory

  Freight value has impact on customer decision to buy a product or not

2. Hypothesis

  High freight value reduces sales

3. Metrics

  Linear regression of freight values variables, freight values segmentation, freight values and price correlation, freight values trends over time, product category by revenue - pareto, product categories price brands


4. Modeling and inference

  Does higher freight value reduces sales?

  Counterfactual hypothesis

  Lower freight values increases sales


Conclusion

  Hypothesis cannot be rejected because freight values after certain value level start to discourage customers to make purchases

  Product weight has highest impact on freight value
  After freight value reaches 25% of overall product price it start to negativelly affect sales
  Freight values positively correlates with prices
  Over time overall freight values increase followed by a number of orders, while prices decrease
  20% of product categories generates 80% of revenue
  Out of the 20% most revenue generating product categories office-furniture has highest average freight value
  Over time the 20% most revenue generating product categories freight values increases
  Out the 20% most revenue generating product categories lowest average feight values generates highest number of orders
  Geographical location has impact on sales: highest average freight value by customer & seller states has lowest number of orders

Recommendations:

  Freight value estimation should be improved in order to reduce shipping cost, because freight value trends does not correspond to overall trends in product pricing and number of orders.
  Potential improvement could be achieved by addressing unequal geographical distribution of customers by opening more distribution centers outside San Paulo urban area.
