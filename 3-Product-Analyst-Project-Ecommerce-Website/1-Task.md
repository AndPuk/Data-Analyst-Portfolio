I am a product analyst in a web company that operates across a few industries, one of which is e-commerce. I am in a team that works on an online store, releases new features on it, and analyzes users' behavior there. My main stakeholder is the product manager (PM) of this product, though occasionally I get requests from designers, backenders, and a researcher who works in my team.
