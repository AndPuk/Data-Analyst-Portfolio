I am a product analyst in a web company that operates across a few industries, one of which is e-commerce. I am in a team that works on an online store, releases new features on it, and analyzes users' behavior there. My main stakeholder is the product manager (PM) of this product, though occasionally I get requests from designers, backenders, and a researcher who works in my team. I have a task from your product manager to identify how much time it takes for a user to make a purchase on your website. My PM would like to see the users' duration from first arriving on the website on any given day until their first purchase on that same day.
