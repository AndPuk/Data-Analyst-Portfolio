4. Modeling and inference

Does longer purchase session duration increase revenues?


5. Counterfactual hypothesis

6. Insights

a) After a 2-hour long purchase session, a significant drop in revenue growth;
b) Although during longer purchase duration sessions on average order value is higher;
c) The majority of sales are done by new customers;

d) The shortest (0 - 5 min) and the longest (2 - 24 hours) purchase duration session negatively affect revenue generation;

e) Purchase session duration time between 5 minutes and 2 hours positively affects revenue generation;

f) Desktop users on average spend more time before purchase than mobile users and generate  26% more revenue;

g) Mobile users are more sensitive to purchase duration session time and after 1 hour generate significantly lower revenues.

The hypothesis can be rejected because, after a certain period, sales start to decrease while session duration time increases.

8. Recommendations:

The mobile version should be adapted to better cater to mobile users while making purchases.
