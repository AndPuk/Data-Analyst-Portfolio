1. Theory

Customer purchase session duration affects sales dynamics

2. Hypothesis

Longer purchase session duration increases revenues

3. Metrics

Daily purchase duration, daily spending, purchase by device type, time of purchase, new & returning customer


4. Modeling and inference

Does longer purchase session duration increase revenues?


5. Counterfactual hypothesis

Shorter purchase session duration increases revenues


7. Conclusion

The hypothesis can be rejected because after a certain period, sales start to decrease while session duration time increases

After 2-hour long purchase session, a significant drop in revenue growth
Although during longer purchase duration sessions on average order value is higher
The majority of sales are done by new customers
The shortest (0 - 5 min) and the longest (2 - 24 hours) purchase duration session negatively affect revenue generation
Purchase session duration time between 5 minutes and 2 hours positively affects revenue generation
Desktop users on average spend more time before purchase than mobile users and generate  26% more revenue
Mobile users are more sensitive to purchase duration session time and after 1 hour generate significantly lower revenues

Recommendations:

The mobile version should be adapted to better cater to mobile users while making purchases
